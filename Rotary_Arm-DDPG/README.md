# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

This project is part of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program by Udacity. This code demonstrates an 
implementation of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm in order to solve a 
[Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) 
environment.

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that 
the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target 
location for as many time steps as possible.


### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your 
   operating system:

    - **_Version 1: One (1) Agent_**
        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    - **_Version 2: Twenty (20) Agents_**
        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `Rotary_Arm-DDPG` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the 
   file.

3. Ensure the following dependencies are installed.

### Requirements
<ul>
<li>python - v3.6</li>
<li>unityagents - v0.4.0</li>
<li>pytorch - v1.0.0</li>
<li>numpy - v1.19.5</li>
<li>matplotlib - v3.3.4</li>
</ul>

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in `Continuous_Control.ipynb` to get started. The goal is to achieve an average score of +30 
over 100 consecutive episodes.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of
the arm. Given this informmation, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the
action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.
