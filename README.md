# Deep Reinforcement Learning
This repo contains some of the projects I have been working on as part of the 
[Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) 
by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). Each project contains its own `README.md` with details on the method used, as 
well as requirments, instructions and license info.

### Contents
- <b>Banana Navigation - Deep Q Networks:</b> An implementation of Deep Q Learning using a navigation 
  task in a 3D virtual environment. Also included is a report detailing the implementation, hyperparameters and results.
- <b>Hill Climbing:</b> A notebook containing a simple implementation of Hill Climbing using OpenAI Gym's Cartpole environment. In addition to 
  vanilla hill climbing, this notebook includes options to implement adaptive noise scaling, steepest ascent and cross entropy.
- <b>Taxi - TD Methods:</b> A demonstration of how Temporal Difference learning can be used to solve a spatial 
navigation task. The implementation includes options for sarsa, sarsamax and expected-sarsa control methods.
